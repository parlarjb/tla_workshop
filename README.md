# tla_workshop

This is the complete set of materials for my rax.io TLA+ workshop.

The contents of this workshop are generally based on Leslie Lamport's [video series](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html). My thought there was that if we don't finish the workshop in the three hours we have, you'll have a fantastically produced video series with which to continue learning.

The complete workshop slides are available in their original Keynote format, zipped into `tla_workshop.zip`. A PDF version of the slides is available at `tla_workshop.pdf`. This was generated by turning every slide transition/animation into a separate page in the PDF.

The cheat sheet with common TLA+ idioms and syntax (as covered in the workshop) is in `tla_cheatsheet.pdf`. Please note that this cheat sheet does not cover _all_ of TLA+, just the material in this workshop. Leslie Lamport's "official" cheat sheet can be found at [http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/summary.pdf](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/summary.pdf).

The TLA+ spec files used in the workshop can be found in the `specs/` directory. These are all from Lamport's video series, with either minor or no modifications.
